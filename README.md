## How to use this Docker image

### Phpipam

```bash
$ docker run -ti -d -p 8080:80 --name ipam \
		-e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_HOST=mysql \
		-e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_USER=phpipam \
		-e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASS=phpipam \
		-e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_NAME=phpipam \
		-e MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PORT=3306 \
		rkojedzinszky/phpipam
```

We are linking the two containers and expose the HTTP port.

For proxies:
Use -e TRUSTED_IP_ENV=IP to allow overwrite remote_addr with X-Forwarded-For by a specified proxy
use -e TRUSTED_IP_ENV=all to allow overwrite by any proxy

For timezone:
Use -e TZ=Europe/Budapest
### Specific integration (HTTPS, multi-host containers, etc.)

Regarding your requirements and docker setup, you've to expose resources.

For HTTPS, run a reverse-proxy in front of your phpipam container and link it to.

For multi-host containers, expose ports, run etcd or consul to make service discovery works etc.
